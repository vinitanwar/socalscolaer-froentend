      "Plastic production has skyrocketed over the last 70 years. In 1950, the world produced just two million tonnes of plastic. Fast forward to today, and production has surpassed 450 million tonnes annually, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. While plastics have brought immense value to human lives through their versatility, cost-effectiveness, and utility in industries ranging from medical to agriculture, their environmental consequences are severe and far-reaching. When we look at these statistics, that are very alarming that over 1 million plastic bottles are purchased worldwide every minute. While a single plastic bag takes 20-1,000 years to decompose.",
      "The Problem at Hand",
      "Plastics are synthetic, organic polymers primarily derived from fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas. From construction materials to food packaging, plastics have become indispensable. However, the other side of this convenience emerges when plastic waste is mismanaged failing to be recycled and disposed of in sealed landfills. This vast pollution impacts all ecosystems, including land, freshwater, and marine, and is a major cause of biodiversity loss and ecological degradation. In marine environments, plastics mainly come from land runoff, discarded fishing gear, and ship waste. Over time, macroplastics break down into microplastics (less than 5mm) and nanoplastics (less than 100nm), which can infiltrate food chains and even enter human bodies.",
      "Plastic trash has the most evident effects on wildlife, including ingestion, asphyxia, and entanglement. Birds, whales, fish, and turtles mistake indigestible plastic garbage for food and starve to death when their stomachs grow overfilled. It also causes internal and external damage, limiting the ability to swim and fly. Plastic pollution affects domestic farm animals as well. Floating plastics transmit invasive alien species, which are one of the primary drivers of biodiversity loss and extinction. In metropolitan areas with poorly managed waste, cows and other cattle often ingest plastic while foraging in open dumps or garbage piles. Consuming plastic bags and wrappers can block their digestive tracts, leading to severe health issues like indigestion, internal injuries, and malnutrition. Over time, the accumulation of plastics in their stomachs causes reduced appetite, weakness, and even death. Toxic chemicals from plastics can also contaminate their milk, posing risks to human health. Proper waste management and awareness are essential to protect cattle and prevent such harmful consequences.",
      "Studies have detected microplastics in human blood, placentas, and everyday consumables like tap water, beer, and salt. Many chemicals used in plastic production are carcinogenic and can cause developmental, reproductive, and immune disorders. The impact disproportionately burdens developing nations, islands, indigenous communities, and marginalized groups that lack infrastructure to manage plastic waste effectively.",

      "Project Sarathi, a student volunteer-driven hospital navigation initiative launched by PGIMER on May 5, 2024, has now expanded nationally, adopted by 1,467 hospitals across 34 states and Union Territories under the “Seva Se Seekhen – Experiential Learning Programme (ELP)” hosted on the MyBharat portal. A unique initiative project, ‘Sarathi’, launched by PGIMER, is a commendable step towards addressing the emotional and social challenges faced by patients in the hospitals. Volunteers from the National Service Scheme (NSS) are at the heart of this initiative. The NSS, a Central Sector Scheme under the Government of India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, plays a crucial role in mobilizing the student youth of our country. By engaging students from 11th and 12th grades, as well as those in technical institutions and universities, NSS provides a platform for them to participate in community service activities. This new initiative cultivates the essence of ‘SEVA’ (selfless service) and promotes civic responsibility among the younger generation.",
      "With an annual influx of over 30 lakh patients, PGIMER, Chandigarh, has often faced challenges in managing the rush. Many of whom travel from far-flung areas, mainly from Panjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh, the burden on hospital staff has been immense. Recognizing this gap, ‘Sarathi’ aimed at alleviating the strain on medical personnel while offering human compassion to patients navigating the complex healthcare system on their own. The volunteers play a crucial role in enhancing the patient experience by assisting with registration, guiding them to various departments, and offering emotional support during stressful times. For many patients, especially those who lack family support, having a dedicated volunteer by their side can significantly alleviate feelings of anxiety and isolation. These volunteers provide not only practical assistance but also a reassuring presence, helping patients feel more comfortable and less alone in their healthcare journey.",
      "At PGIMER alone, 816 students from 18 academic institutions have contributed over 50,340 service hours till June 2025, significantly enhancing patient experience by reducing average wait times from 4.2 to 2.8 hours, improving patient satisfaction, and relieving hospital staff workload. Project Sarathi represents a unique convergence of youth service and healthcare innovation. As Chandigarh continues to set new benchmarks in patient care, this initiative stands as a shining example of how community involvement can transform healthcare delivery. Project ‘Sarathi’ may prove particularly effective during challenging times, such as pandemics, when hospitals experience a massive influx of patients. The increased demand can place immense pressure on medical staff, making it difficult to provide personalized care to every individual. By enlisting the support of trained volunteers, hospital administration can alleviate some of this burden, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on critical medical tasks while ensuring patients receive the guidance and emotional support they need.",

      "India, as a modern-day exemplar of democratic values, stands at a critical juncture in its journey toward becoming a Viksit Bharat (Developed India). Elections, the cornerstone of democracy, are important to the nation's governance. Today, the major challenges related to elections include their frequent occurrence, the need for extensive election machinery, significant costs and time involved, suspension of development activities due to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), managing expenses, voter registration, and tackling election-related malpractices. Therefore, frequent elections across various parts of the country place a heavy burden on resources and have a negative impact on the economy and developmental progress. The proposed reform of One Nation, One Election (ONOE) emerges as a transformative solution to these challenges. For citizens, this reform promises a respite from the constant cycle of political activity, allowing them to focus on their livelihoods without frequent electoral disruptions. Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal's introduction of the One Nation, One Election Bill in the Lok Sabha has ignited widespread debate in political and public circles. The bill saw 269 Members of Parliament voting in favour, while 198 opposed it. The idea aims to simplify India’s electoral process by synchronizing the election cycles of the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies. Opposition parties, including the Congress, the Left, and the Trinamool Congress, have expressed strong dissent, arguing that the ‘One Nation, One Election’ proposal weaken India’s federal structure. They contend that it risks eroding the autonomy of state governments, potentially granting the central government greater influence over state affairs.",
      "Historical Context",
      "India conducted simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies from 1951 to 1967. This practice ended due to the premature dissolution of some State Assemblies and the Fourth Lok Sabha in the late 1960s. The political instability of subsequent decades led to staggered elections, which have since become the norm. India’s democratic system has seen over 400 elections to the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies since independence. However, frequent elections have raised concerns about inefficiency. The goal of simultaneous elections, also known as One Nation, One Election, is to match the dates of the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies elections. Voters would cast their ballots for both on the same day, though the process could still take place in phases across the country. This approach aims to reduce logistical challenges, cut costs, and minimize disruptions.",
      "In September 2023, the Union Government established a six-member High-Level Committee, led by former President Shri Ram Nath Kovind, to explore the feasibility of implementing simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha, State Assemblies, and local bodies. After consulting the public, political parties, and experts, the committee released its findings. The report recommended constitutional amendments to Articles 82A and 324A to facilitate simultaneous elections. The proposal suggests implementing these changes in two phases: first, synchronizing elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, and second, for local bodies like Municipalities and Panchayats. The committee also addressed the issue of hung assemblies, suggesting a mechanism for conducting new elections with reduced terms if necessary. The committee’s report, accepted by the Union Cabinet in September 2024, forms the backbone of the current proposal. The committee also proposed creating a Single Electoral Roll and a Single EPIC for all government elections.",
      "The rationale for simultaneous elections includes promoting consistency in governance, preventing policy paralysis, reducing resource diversion, preserving regional party relevance, and enhancing political opportunities. It would allow political parties to focus more on governance instead of constant election campaigns. Financially, it would lower the costs related to election cycles. However, the bill is also seen as granting powers to the Election Commission and central authorities, undermining state autonomy and marginalize regional parties, as national issues may dominate, and raise concerns about the consolidation of political power in larger national parties, limiting electoral competition.",
      "The idea of ONOE presents a progressive vision for India’s democracy. Although its advantages are considerable, implementing this reform involves addressing valid concerns related to federalism, logistical challenges, and necessary constitutional changes. Achieving consensus among political parties and state governments will be essential for the success of this initiative. The ONOE proposal has the potential to reshape India’s political landscape in several ways. By consolidating elections into a single electoral system, it could enhance voter engagement, as citizens may feel more connected to the democratic process. This unified approach could simplify the electoral cycle and encourage greater participation, which is a positive sign for a vibrant democracy like India. With fewer elections disintegrate across time, the focus could shift towards more meaningful debates and discussions, ultimately strengthening democratic participation at all levels. The ONOE initiative has the potential to enhance effective resource utilization across the country. By reducing the anticipated expenditure on frequent elections, it can redirect valuable funds toward welfare programs in critical areas such as health, education, and social development. In certain regions in India face challenges like lack of familiarity with the electoral process, insurgency, violence, and infiltration, which effects public participation in democracy. These issues also pose difficulties for returning officers and electoral staff in discharging their duties effectively. Implementing ONOE could address these challenges, ensuring a more effective and inclusive electoral process.",
      "A constitution must be a living document, evolving to meet the changing needs and aspirations of society. It should remain dynamic, effective, and efficient, adapting to new challenges while addressing the growing expectations of citizens. However, this flexibility must not come at the cost of its core values and foundational principles, such as democracy, free and fair elections, and federalism, which must remain inviolable.",

      "India, a land celebrated for its spiritual heritage and the ancient adage “Atithi Devo Bhava” (The guest is God), is currently grappling with a disturbing contradiction. While tourism campaigns highlight India’s hospitality, a series of heinous crimes against foreign women tourists has marred the country’s global image. The U.S. Department of State, in its latest travel advisory, has warned its citizens, particularly women, not to travel alone in India. The warning is grounded in a grim reality: sexual violence, particularly rape, remains one of the fastest-growing crimes in the country. The UK’s travel advisory for India delivers a stark warning: “Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, across several Indian states.” It advises women to “avoid isolated areas, including beaches, even during the daytime.” Similarly, Australia urges female travellers to exercise caution, advising against traveling alone even in major cities and well-frequented tourist spots. In addition to the threat of sexual violence, foreign women tourists often face constant harassment in the form of unsolicited photography, aggressive staring, and intrusive behaviour. Many have reported being followed, groped in crowded areas, and even robbed.",

      "Udaipur, Rajasthan (June 23, 2025): A 30-year-old French tourist was allegedly raped by an employee of an event management company. The accused is currently absconding, and a manhunt is underway.",
      " Koppal, Karnataka (March 9, 2025): An Israeli woman and her Indian homestay operator were gang-raped while stargazing near the heritage town of Hampi. A male tourist was also murdered during the attack. All three accused have been arrested, but the incident prompted hundreds of tourists to flee the UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "Delhi (March 13, 2025): A British woman was allegedly raped by a man she met through social media. Her trauma deepened when she was molested by another person in a hotel lift while seeking help. Both men have been arrested.",
      "The article by Karanjeet Kaur, published in Theprint highlights the alarming rise in crimes against foreign women tourists in India, exposing a disturbing pattern of sexual violence. She wrote Between 2016 and 2022, only 5% of rape cases involving foreign women in India resulted in convictions. The reputational damage to India’s global image is severe, compounded by viral testimonies from survivors. These crimes not only deter tourism, costing the nation economically, but also reflect issues of gender-based violence that hinder India’s progress.",
      "These incidents are not isolated. They indicate a larger pattern of predatory behaviour, systemic failures in prevention and justice delivery, and inadequate tourist safety protocols. The ripple effect on India's tourism industry is palpable, with negative advisories impacting arrivals and denting the nation's soft power on the global stage.",
      "The Gap Between Law and Enforcement",
      "Despite the strong legal framework, the problem lies in inefficient enforcement, a lack of coordination among tourism departments and law enforcement, and cultural apathy toward crimes against women. Cases involving foreign tourists are often mishandled due to linguistic barriers, slow investigation processes, and bureaucratic delays, leading to loss of trust and global outrage.",

      "Possible Solutions",
      "To enhance the safety of foreign tourists in India and restore global confidence in the country’s hospitality, a comprehensive and multi-layered approach is essential. First and foremost, well-trained, multilingual tourist police units should be established in major travel destinations, especially those frequented by foreign visitors. These units must operate 24x7 and be equipped with cultural sensitivity training and basic foreign language skills to effectively assist international guests. Public areas, accommodations, and tourist hotspots must be outfitted with QR-code-enabled panic buttons linked to immediate response mechanisms. In parallel, the judiciary should set up fast-track courts dedicated to crimes against tourists, adhering strictly to the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita timelines of 60 to 90 days for swift justice. International victims must be granted immediate access to legal aid, translators, and online case tracking systems to ensure transparency and continued support. To strengthen accountability in the hospitality sector, rigorous background checks for hotel staff, homestay operators, guides, and tour operators should be made mandatory, backed by a centralized offender tracking database. Homestays and guesthouses must be brought under a strict regulatory framework, including licensing and surveillance requirements, while all hospitality staff should undergo training in identifying and responding to criminal or suspicious activities. Social media platforms and travel aggregators should partner with authorities to disseminate safety advisories and promote responsible tourism. Tourists should also be educated about the dangers of meeting unknown individuals via digital platforms and encouraged to use only verified, reputable services. Targeted safety campaigns in multiple foreign languages can further reinforce awareness by providing safety tips and emergency contacts. Lastly, community policing initiatives should be encouraged, empowering residents to participate in and contribute to the protection of visitors.",
    ],
    quote:
      "India’s cultural legacy and natural beauty attract millions, but safety is paramount. A single incident of sexual violence not only devastates the victim but also tarnishes the nation’s global image and impacts its tourism industry. The Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita provides a strong foundation to fight such crimes, but it must be backed by rigorous enforcement, public accountability, and a remarkable societal shift in attitude. The safety of every visitor is the responsibility of the host. In safeguarding foreign tourists, India must rise not only to protect its guests but also to uphold the very ethos it proudly proclaims to the world, ensuring that The guest is god is not just a saying, but a lived reality.",

      "The respect for women increases manifold when she is addressed as janni meaning creator. The women are equated to the level of a goddess as they also par take part in shaping the universe with their unique power of giving birth. The women have time and again waged battles for securing dignity in the society. The motherhood of the women have often been questioned and the judiciary has always rescued the motherhood from the conservative clutches of the society. Recently the Supreme Court of India in the land mark case of K. Umadevi v. State of Tamil Nadu (Civil Appeal No. 2526 of 2025) recognized maternity benefit as a constitutional right. This move of the Supreme Court has further extended the periphery of reproductive rights and it has included maternity benefit as a part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India dealing with right to dignity. This judgment has brought a balance between motherhood and workplace. Since the women are contributing equally in the progress of the nation and half of the workforce in the country constitutes female workers, this ruling has laid another milestone for gender justice in the country. The court has interpreted the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act to protect women workers though this legislation is not applicable to state government employees. There are many important rulings of the Supreme Court in which the motherhood has been included in the ambit of Article 21. In this case, the Tamil Nadu government’s stance that the maternity benefit cannot be granted if the woman is already having two living children. In this case the women got divorced and the custody of the children was with the husband. On remarriage of the women, a child was born and government under the service rules denied maternity benefit. The court emphasized the importance of maternity benefit that it was designed to protecting working women so that during the period of pregnancy and post natal care, the women worker can survive, nurture and can rejoin service with same energy and efficiency as before pregnancy. denying women this benefit implies the denial of reproductive right. Reproductive rights are not confined to the decision of having or not having children. The reproductive rights encompass many rights like right to health, reproductive choice, sexual health and motherhood. The Indian Supreme Court has always upheld the right of motherhood in many earlier judgments. This ruling has come a long way in protecting the motherhood of working women and ensuring the time for nurturing of the child. Article 21 of the Constitution of India encompasses the right to health care facilities both at the pre natal and post natal stage, enforcement of the reproductive rights of the woman and medical needs of the new born child. In the same light, Article 21 has been interpreted to include maternity benefit for working women as a fundamental right. The maternity benefit has always been interpreted as a statutory right but by overruling the Madras High Court judgment and giving beneficial interpretation for securing social justice. The contention by the learned counsel that denying maternity benefit for the third child is in consonance with the population control program. The maternity leave is given to expectant mothers in their workplaces. The lactating mothers are given the benefit of maternity leave keeping in view the health of the mother. The pregnant women undergo physical and mental stress during gestation period and after delivery. In the cases of pregnancy there are two stages one of pre-natal and second post-natal after delivery of the child. The pregnancy brings about physiological and psychological changes in the pregnant women. By recognizing maternity benefit as part of reproductive rights, the court has upheld the dignity of the women in the workforce also. The initial bond between mother and child is very important for the early growth and it lays foundation for the life-long development of the child. In case of denial of maternity benefit would result in the loss of development of emotional bond between the child and mother. The nurturing of the child in the womb develops a social, emotional and physical bond between the mother and the child. The changing social structures and norms regarding family have brought great transformation. In such familial changes if strict strictures are passed, the family structure shall crumble as most of the young people are avoiding marriage and not conceiving children. This relief by the court has come to the rescue of working women. The women workforce with such benefits shall contribute heart-heartedly for the progress of their institution without the fear of thinking about their kids. This judgment is very progressive and it has expanded the arena of reproductive rights. The reproductive rights are not confined with to whether to have or not have children. But reproductive rights now encompass so many rights including the maternity benefit also. By including maternity benefit within the ambit of Article 21, the Supreme Court of India has upheld the dignity of the working women. Though population control is the policy objective of the government but this judgment to some extent has brought balance between social justice and equity. The court has played proactive role in interpreting the government policy in the constitutional spirit. ",

      "While Manipur has dominated national headlines in recent years due to ethnic violence, political instability, and the imposition of President’s Rule in early 2025, another grave issue remains largely overlooked. It is not about bombs or bullets, but about how young Manipuris are treated when they step outside their troubled homeland in pursuit of education and peace.",
      "In February 2025, we conducted a study in Chandigarh involving 100 students from Manipur enrolled in various colleges and universities. The findings were sobering: 98 out of 100 respondents reported facing racism or stereotyping at some point during their stay. These were not isolated or exaggerated anecdotes; they were the lived experiences of youth seeking refuge and opportunity, only to find ignorance and alienation.",
      "Many students had left Manipur in the aftermath of the 2023 ethnic conflict, hoping to rebuild their lives far from home. But what awaited them was a different kind of struggle. Some were subjected to derogatory nicknames like “Momo” or “Coronavirus,” mocking their appearance and culture. Others recounted being stared at, ridiculed for their accents, or mistaken for foreigners ‘Nepalese’ or ‘Ladakhi’ because of their ‘Mongoloid’ features. A common sentiment echoed in the interviews was the feeling of being perpetually watched, judged, or made to feel invisible even in public places like libraries and classrooms.",
      "These instances are symptomatic of a deeper malaise: the systemic neglect of India’s Northeast in national consciousness. The Northeast is rarely represented in school curricula, media narratives, or mainstream cultural discourse. This invisibility fuels ignorance, which often metastasizes into prejudice and discrimination. As one student poignantly shared, “People asked where I was ‘really’ from, or commented on how different our food looked. It felt like we were exhibits in a museum.”",
      "Yet, the story is not without hope. Many students acknowledged acts of kindness and acceptance, from supportive professors to inclusive classmates and neighbours. Some noted that their institutions were beginning to promote diversity and foster safer environments. A few believed that awareness about the Northeast was slowly improving, driven by education and increased mobility. However, none of the students felt fully at home in Chandigarh. Their roots, their language, and their identity remained anchored in Manipur. This is not merely a story of discrimination- it is a call for national introspection. The plight of Manipuri students reflects a larger pattern of internal displacement, emotional trauma, and marginalization experienced by many from the Northeast. It is high time India confronts this reality, not with token gestures, but with structural reforms and sustained empathy.Educational institutions must take the lead. Cultural orientation programs, sensitization workshops, and accessible grievance redressal systems are essential, not optional. The curriculum must be revised to represent the Northeast’s rich histories and cultures accurately and prominently. Public discourse must evolve to recognize the diversity within Indian identity as a strength, not a deviation. As a society, we must move from passive indifference to active inclusion. Unity in India cannot rest on forced uniformity; it must be nurtured through understanding, dignity, and justice. These young people from Manipur, and countless others like them, deserve to study in peace, without fear or alienation. Simultaneously, the government must intensify efforts to restore lasting peace and stability in Manipur. No student should be forced to choose between safety and home. ",

What began as a long-standing shadow conflict has now spilled over into direct military strikes, threatening not only regional peace but also global energy and economic stability.",

      "From Allies to Adversaries: A Brief History of Iran-Israel Relations",
      "In a historical irony, Iran was one of the first Muslim-majority nations to recognize Israel after its establishment in 1948. Under the pro-Western Pahlavi monarchy, Iran maintained close economic and strategic ties with Israel, even supplying it with oil during the Arab boycott.",
      "However, this relationship came to a screeching halt after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Ayatollah Khomeini’s regime redefined Iran’s foreign policy, positioning Israel as an illegitimate occupier of Palestine.

      "The turning point came when Israeli jets struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus in April 2025, killing senior Iranian military commanders. Iran retaliated with an unprecedented aerial assault: over 300 drones and missiles targeted Israeli cities.

      "Iran suspended the next round of nuclear talks, accusing the U.S. of bias and bad faith. Tehran sees the growing military pressure as part of a broader strategy to force its surrender. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated that uranium enrichment is a “red line” and warned that continued attacks could compel Iran to reassess its nuclear restraint.",

      "Global Consequences: Energy Markets on Edge",
      "The attacks have rattled global oil markets. Iran, which holds around 9% of global oil reserves, exports up to 2 million barrels a day, mainly to China. Any disruption to this output—or to transport through the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint for 20% of global oil flows—poses systemic risk.",
      "Brent crude surged over 6%, and West Texas Intermediate rose more than 5% after the Israeli strikes. Experts warn that if the conflict escalates, fuel prices will rise sharply worldwide, including in India, Australia, and Southeast Asia. This could spur inflation, delay central bank rate cuts, and strain economies already battling high energy costs.",
      "Even countries not importing Iranian oil, like Australia, are vulnerable. Australian fuel prices are pegged to global benchmarks, and any spike in crude oil prices affects domestic transport, logistics, and agriculture.",

      "The Road Ahead: Few Good Options",
      "Iran’s leadership is now pursuing a strategy of calibrated escalation. It seeks to project strength without triggering full-scale war with Israel or direct U.S. intervention. But that balance is hard to maintain. Already, Iranian strikes have caused significant damage in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while Israeli responses continue to hit deep within Iran’s borders.",
      "In Tehran’s view, any concession now would not stave off regime change; it would invite it. The ruling elite believes that standing firm is the only way to maintain legitimacy at home and deter further foreign aggression.",
      "At the same time, Israel appears determined to keep Iran from achieving nuclear capability, even if it means widening the war.",

      "The recent “Operation Sindoor” signifies a strong moment in India’s strategic response to the persistent threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan. This operation, a direct and forceful retaliation, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, also within Pakistan’s Punjab province, marking a significant escalation in India’s willingness to project power across the border. The decisive nature of Operation Sindoor characterizes it as “a crushing reply” to Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism. This operation involved surgical precision, reaching beyond the contested territory of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into the heart of Pakistan’s Punjab, effectively dismantling terrorist camps within what is considered sovereign Pakistani territory. The immediate aftermath of this operation has been met with widespread jubilation in India, seen as a long-awaited response to the persistent provocations, particularly the recent incident in Pahalgam, where civilians were targeted.",

      "This Operation and its preceding surgical strikes (2016 and 2019) represent a fundamental shift in India’s strategic doctrine towards Pakistan. The Focus on Security and Counter-terrorism is one of the key tenets of the ‘Modi Doctrine in Foreign Policy.’ Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, India conducted precision airstrikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan, demonstrating a shift from defensive to offensive counter-terrorism measures. The question posed is whether these operations have become the primary tool for ensuring strategic deterrence against Pakistan’s state-sponsored terrorism. India now views surgical operations characterized as non-escalatory as the sole recourse in response to any future terrorist attacks originating from Pakistani soil. The article delves into the historical trajectory of India-Pakistan conflicts to contextualize the current strategic posture. The wars of 1947-48, 1965, and 1971 are highlighted as conventional military engagements where Pakistan suffered decisive defeats. These conventional losses led to a strategic recalibration within Pakistan. Recognizing its inability to compete with India on a conventional military footing, Pakistan adopted a strategy of asymmetric warfare, primarily through the sponsorship of terrorism. A crucial turning point in this strategic calculus was India’s nuclear test in 1974, termed a “peaceful nuclear explosion.” This development underscored Pakistan’s conventional inferiority and further solidified its resolve to acquire nuclear capabilities as a deterrent. The period between 1975 and 1995 witnessed Pakistan’s clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons, culminating in its successful tests in 1998, shortly after India’s second round of tests.",

      "The nuclearization of the subcontinent ushered in a new era of strategic interaction. Pakistan, emboldened by its nuclear arsenal, attempted to exploit this new reality during the 1999 Kargil conflict. Pakistan’s incursion into the Kargil was predicated on the assumption that India, constrained by the nuclear overhang, would be hesitant to mount a strong military response. However, India’s resolute counter-offensive, successfully evicting Pakistani forces despite the nuclear backdrop, served as a significant lesson for Pakistan that its nuclear weapons did not provide immunity from conventional retaliation. Following the Kargil debacle, Pakistan shifted its tactics further towards terrorism, exemplified by the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. This act of terror was a calculated attempt to test India’s response in a nuclearized environment. Pakistan sought to ascertain whether India would risk a conventional military retaliation, which could potentially escalate to a nuclear exchange, given India’s stated “no first use” nuclear doctrine. India’s response to the Parliament attacks, while including Operation Parakram, did not involve a direct military reprisal against Pakistan itself, which inadvertently emboldened Pakistan to believe its nuclear arsenal provided a shield for its terrorist activities. The period between 2002 and 2014 witnessed a sustained campaign of terror against India, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008 and attacks on Amarnath pilgrims in 2009. Throughout this period, India’s perceived restraint, often attributed to the fear of nuclear escalation, fostered a sense of impunity within Pakistan.",

      "However, the strategic landscape began to shift after 2014. A reassessment of India’s approach led to the articulation of a more assertive doctrine, one that rejected the perceived passivity of the past. The objective became to deliver a decisive response to any act of terror, ensuring that Pakistan would face tangible consequences for its actions. The challenge lay in devising a retaliatory strategy that would inflict significant damage without triggering a nuclear escalation. The 2016 surgical strikes following the Uri attack marked a strategic experiment in this new approach. India’s special forces crossed the Line of Control into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, targeting and destroying terrorist launchpads. This operation served multiple purposes. Firstly, it delivered a direct blow to terrorist infrastructure. Secondly, it tested Pakistan’s reaction to such a cross-border incursion. Crucially, India framed the operation in a way that created a “deniability game” for Pakistan. India placed Pakistan in a difficult situation by attacking terrorist camps in areas it considers its own land that is illegally occupied by Pakistan. Acknowledging the strikes would implicitly admit the presence of terrorist launchpads on its soil, while denying them would contradict India’s public assertion of the operation’s success. The 2019 Balakot airstrikes following the Pulwama attack represented a further evolution of this strategy. This time, India ventured deeper into Pakistan’s territory, targeting a terrorist training camp in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. This demonstrated India’s willingness and capability to strike terrorist targets anywhere within Pakistan, not just in the disputed territories. Similar to the 2016 strikes, Pakistan denied the extent of the damage, but India’s message was clear that its operational space for retaliation was no longer limited. Operation Sindoor, in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks, builds upon this evolving strategic framework, highlighting two key aspects of this operation. Firstly, it aimed to deliver justice for both the civilian and terrorist casualties of the Pahalgam incident, suggesting a more comprehensive targeting approach. Secondly, it extended the operational reach even further into Pakistan’s heartland, specifically mentioning the illegal occupation of Punjab. This signifies a clear message that no part of Pakistan providing sanctuary to terrorists is beyond India’s reach. Operation has solidified two crucial understandings for India. Firstly, the principle of differentiated retaliation means responding to attacks on civilians and terrorists accordingly, and secondly, the acceptance that terrorist infrastructure anywhere in Pakistan is a legitimate target.",

      "However, it is suggested that India needs to adopt a more proactive and aggressive strategic posture. The more contentious proposal is a fundamental shift in India’s nuclear doctrine from “no first use” to “first use.” The researcher acknowledges the potential international backlash, particularly from Western nations, but argues that such concerns should be secondary to India’s strategic imperatives, as the West’s dependence on India outweighs India’s dependence on them. Furthermore, a “first use” doctrine would force Pakistan to maintain a state of permanent nuclear readiness, incurring significant economic costs and potentially fuelling public discontent against the military establishment. The potential counter-argument is that a shift in nuclear doctrine could lead to Chinese intervention in Pakistan, positing that such an intervention, where China might offer to underwrite Pakistan’s nuclear readiness, could be strategically advantageous for India. It would expose China’s role in nuclear proliferation, damaging its global image and potentially diverting Western attention from India’s doctrinal shift. It is believed that China’s internal challenges and global ambitions would ultimately limit its willingness to provide unconditional support to Pakistan.",

      "In conclusion, India should adopt a multi-pronged approach that combines assertive retaliatory actions like Operation Sindoor with proactive measures and a revision of India’s nuclear doctrine. These steps are necessary to fundamentally alter Pakistan’s strategic calculus, deter its support for terrorism, and ultimately contribute to its internal destabilization, potentially leading to a scenario where the Pakistani masses hold its military accountable.",

      "Public transportation serves as a lifeline for millions of women worldwide, providing them with essential access to education, employment, and economic participation. A study by the European Commission on transportation habits across multiple countries confirmed that women rely more on public transit and walking compared to men. In India, particularly in major metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, women face severe threats while using public transport. Overcrowded buses and metro trains create an environment where perpetrators operate with impunity, exploiting the lack of surveillance and accountability.",

      "A 2024 study published in the Journal of Transport Geography found that 17.5% of women surveyed had experienced at least four incidents of harassment while using public transport. More disturbingly, 8.6% reported serious offenses, including public masturbation and rape.",

      "Many working women avoid public transportation altogether due to safety concerns, significantly affecting their career choices, economic independence, and quality of life. Women who do not have access to private transportation often find themselves in a vulnerable position, forced to choose between personal safety and professional advancement.",

      "Countries worldwide have implemented various strategies to enhance women’s safety in public transport, yielding positive results. In Japan and Mexico, for instance, women-only train compartments and buses have reduced the risk of harassment. Other measures, such as panic buttons, emergency helplines, enhanced police presence at stations, and CCTV surveillance, have been instrumental in improving safety. The integration of technology through mobile applications allows women to report harassment in real time, access emergency assistance, and track their travel routes securely.",

      "Ensuring women’s safety while travelling is not merely a matter of convenience — it is a fundamental human right. The Indian government and transportation authorities must act decisively to address this crisis. This includes enforcing strict laws with severe penalties for sexual harassment in public spaces, increasing investments in women-centric transportation infrastructure, and leveraging technology-driven solutions for real-time reporting and monitoring of harassment cases. Regular safety audits, public awareness campaigns, and gender-sensitivity training for transport personnel must become standard practices to create a safer commuting environment. A truly equitable society is one where every woman can step onto a bus or train with confidence, knowing that her safety is not at risk.",

      "Ladakh, often referred to as the 'Land of High Passes,' is a unique and historically rich region of northern India. Nestled in the trans-Himalayan belt, Ladakh has long maintained an identity distinct from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). With deep-rooted Tibetan Buddhist influences, the region historically functioned as an independent Buddhist kingdom before its annexation by the Dogra rulers of Jammu in 1834. This annexation marked the beginning of Ladakh’s prolonged marginalization within the larger princely state of J&K, a pattern that continued post-independence under Indian rule.",

      "The Marginalization of Ladakh in J&K Politics: For centuries, Ladakh’s governance has been dictated by external powers with little regard for its distinct cultural and developmental needs. The region remained on the periphery of administrative priorities under the Dogras, British, and later, independent India. Leh often found itself at odds with the Muslim-dominated state government in Srinagar. This imbalance led to Ladakhi demands for direct central governance as early as the 1950s, championed by leaders like Kushok Bakula Rinpoche and Nawang Rigzin Jora.",

      "The Demand for Union Territory Status: For decades, Ladakhis pushed for UT status, seeking direct administration from New Delhi to address political neglect, lack of infrastructure, and cultural concerns. On August 5, 2019, the Indian government revoked Article 370 and 35A, turning Ladakh into a Union Territory without a legislature — a move celebrated in Leh but opposed in Kargil.",

      "The Double-Edged Sword of UT Status: While UT status brought Ladakh closer to central governance, it also removed local democratic governance. The region now relies on two Autonomous Hill Development Councils (in Leh and Kargil), which have limited powers. Many local leaders argue for greater autonomy and decision-making authority.",

      "Cultural and Ecological Concerns: The removal of special status has triggered fears of environmental degradation due to increased industrialization and tourism. Ladakhi languages and cultural practices are under pressure as Hindi and English become dominant. Religious traditions are also at risk of dilution under growing central influence.",

      "Religious and Ethnic Divisions: Ladakh's Buddhist-majority Leh and Muslim-majority Kargil regions differ in their political outlook. While Leh supported UT status, Kargil opposed the 2019 reorganization, preferring stronger ties with J&K. These divisions complicate Ladakh’s identity politics.",

      "Current Movements and the Path Forward: Groups like the Ladakh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) are advocating for Sixth Schedule protection to secure tribal rights, cultural identity, and land ownership. They also demand an elected legislature, stronger LAHDC autonomy, and ecological safeguards.",

      "Ladakh’s transformation into a Union Territory has brought both recognition and challenges. While it now has direct access to the central government, it lacks political voice and legislative autonomy. As it negotiates its post-2019 identity, the demand for self-governance, cultural preservation, and sustainable development remains urgent.",
